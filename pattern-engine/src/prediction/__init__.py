Predictive Monitoring Module for SAP Workflow Mining.

This module provides predictive process monitoring capabilities for SAP
Order-to-Cash (O2C) workflows. It uses machine learning to predict process
outcomes and generate alerts for at-risk cases.

Key Components:
- FeatureExtractor: Extracts ML features from process events
- ClassificationModel: Predicts binary outcomes (late, credit hold)
- RegressionModel: Predicts continuous values (completion time)
- AlertManager: Generates alerts based on predictions

Main Features:
- Extract features from SAP O2C events (cycle times, document counts, patterns)
- Train classifiers to predict:
  - Will this order be late? (binary classification)
  - Will this order require credit hold? (binary classification)
  - Estimated completion time (regression)
- Alert on high-risk cases with configurable thresholds
- Support both online prediction and batch scoring

Example Usage:
    from prediction import (
        FeatureExtractor,
        ClassificationModel,
        PredictionType,
        AlertManager,
    )

    # Extract features from a trace
    extractor = FeatureExtractor()
    trace = [
        {"activity": "OrderCreated", "timestamp": "2024-01-01T10:00:00"},
        {"activity": "DeliveryCreated", "timestamp": "2024-01-02T14:00:00"},
    ]
    features = extractor.extract(trace, case_id="ORDER001")

    # Train a late delivery model
    model = ClassificationModel(PredictionType.LATE_DELIVERY)
    model.train(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    prediction = model.predict_from_trace(trace, case_id="ORDER001")
    print(f"Late probability: {prediction.probability:.2%}")

    # Check for alerts
    alert_manager = AlertManager()
    alerts = alert_manager.check_prediction(prediction)
    for alert in alerts:
        print(f"Alert: {alert.message}")

Example - Batch Scoring:
    from prediction import PredictiveMonitor, PredictionType

    # Create monitor with all models
    monitor = PredictiveMonitor()
    monitor.add_classifier(PredictionType.LATE_DELIVERY)
    monitor.add_classifier(PredictionType.CREDIT_HOLD)
    monitor.add_regressor(PredictionType.COMPLETION_TIME)

    # Train models
    monitor.train_model(PredictionType.LATE_DELIVERY, X_train, y_late)
    monitor.train_model(PredictionType.CREDIT_HOLD, X_train, y_credit)
    monitor.train_model(PredictionType.COMPLETION_TIME, X_train, y_time)

    # Batch predict
    results = monitor.batch_predict(cases)
    for case_id, predictions in results.items():
        print(f"Case {case_id}:")
        for pred in predictions:
            print(f"  {pred.prediction_type.value}: {pred.predicted_value}")
