## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

#### Natural Language Interface
- New `ask_process` MCP tool for querying SAP processes in plain English
- LLM abstraction layer supporting multiple providers:
  - **Ollama** - Local/private deployment (default for air-gapped environments)
  - **OpenAI** - GPT-4 integration for cloud deployments
  - **Anthropic** - Claude integration as alternative cloud option
- Context-aware responses with evidence citations and recommendations
- Configurable via `LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_API_KEY`, and `LLM_MODEL` environment variables

#### OCEL 2.0 Export
- New `export_ocel` MCP tool for Object-Centric Event Log export
- Full compliance with [OCEL 2.0 standard](https://www.ocel-standard.org/)
- Object types: order, item, delivery, invoice
- Event types: order_created, delivery_created, goods_issued, invoice_created
- Relationship tracking between SAP document objects
- Export formats: JSON (default), XML, SQLite
- Compatible with PM4Py, Celonis, and other OCEL-compliant tools

#### Conformance Checking
- New `check_conformance` MCP tool for process conformance analysis
- Compare actual SAP processes against expected Order-to-Cash models
- Pre-built O2C reference models:
  - Simple model: Order → Delivery → Goods Issue → Invoice
  - Detailed model: Includes optional steps (credit check, picking, packing, payment)
- Deviation detection:
  - Skipped activities (e.g., delivery without order)
  - Wrong order (e.g., invoice before delivery)
  - Unexpected activities
  - Missing mandatory activities
  - Duplicate activities
- Severity scoring: Critical / Major / Minor / Info
- Conformance rate calculation (0-100%)
- Based on van der Aalst's conformance checking algorithms

#### Visual Process Maps
- New `visualize_process` MCP tool for process flow diagrams
- Output formats:
  - **Mermaid** - Markdown-compatible flowcharts
  - **GraphViz DOT** - For complex process graphs
  - **SVG** - Direct visual output
- Bottleneck highlighting with color-coded severity:
  - Green: Fast (normal processing time)
  - Yellow: Medium (approaching threshold)
  - Red: Slow (bottleneck detected)
- Timing annotations between process steps
- Human-readable duration formatting (30m, 4.5h, 2d)

#### Predictive Monitoring
- New `predict_outcome` MCP tool for ML-based predictions
- Prediction types:
  - **Late Delivery** - Probability of delivery delays
  - **Credit Hold** - Likelihood of credit blocks
  - **Completion Time** - Estimated days to complete O2C cycle
- Feature extraction (29 features):
  - Temporal: duration, time since start, activity durations
  - Count: event count, unique activities, order changes
  - Pattern: credit blocks, rework, backward flows
  - State: current stage, completion percentage, blocked status
- ML model types: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ensemble
- Risk scoring with configurable alert thresholds
- Batch prediction support (up to 100 documents)

#### Python Modules
- `pattern-engine/src/ocel/` - OCEL 2.0 export module
- `pattern-engine/src/conformance/` - Conformance checking engine
- `pattern-engine/src/visualization/` - Diagram generation
- `pattern-engine/src/prediction/` - ML prediction and alerting

#### Testing
- 391 new tests for v2.0 features
- Total test count: 605 (314 TypeScript + 291 Python)
- Comprehensive coverage for all new modules

### Changed

- Updated MCP Tools Reference in README with new Process Mining Tools section
- Added LLM Configuration section to README
- Added version badges to README

### Statistics

- **31 files added**
- **11,643 lines of code**
- **5 new MCP tools**
- **4 new Python modules**
